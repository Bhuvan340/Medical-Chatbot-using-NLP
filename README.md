# Medical-Chatbot-using-NLP
This project is a Medical Chatbot designed to assist users with basic health inquiries and provide symptom-based medical advice using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is trained to understand and respond to user input, making it accessible and easy to use for non-technical individuals. By leveraging NLP, the chatbot can process human language, identify medical-related queries, and provide accurate responses or suggestions, helping users gain preliminary insights into their health conditions. This chatbot can serve as a helpful first step before consulting a healthcare professional, promoting health awareness and care.
